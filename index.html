				<p>
					In my surveys and interviews, I found that <b>over 90% of the spreadsheet users surveyed present their data to other people</b>. The majority of the time when users share their spreadsheets with others, it is of <b>simple lists</b> and <b>calculations</b>. Over half of these users complained about the difficult of styling spreadsheets for presentations. Leveraging these insights, I prototyped and tested Schmancy &mdash; a new kind of app that is focused on beautifully styling spreadsheets for presentation, ridiculously fast.
				</p>
				<h2 id="testid">Survey reveals how people really use spreadsheets</h2>
				<p>
					My survey was held on September 30th 2014, and included 30 spreadsheet users, who were acquired through Amazon Turk. The survey followed the qualitative survey model from Qualitative.io. Survey takers were asked about what happens, before, during, and after they use a spreadsheet. This process reveals insight about the needs and actual behavior of users.
				</p>	
				<p>
					The survey produced three major discoveries: that about <b>half the users are performing many quick and simple calculations</b>, that <b>design and layout is a major painpoint</b>, and the vast majority of people <b>share their work</b> with someone else.

				<h2 class="no-chapter">Big Opportunity for &ldquo;Online Calculators&rdquo;</h2>

				<p>To discover what could be used to drive traffic to my app, I used Google’s Keyword Planner tool, which shows how often users search for particular search terms, and what degree of competition there is to reach these users. I found a high degree of search activity around "online calculators" – over 800,000 monthly searches – with a low level of competition. Compared to "spreadsheet" which has only 100,000 monthly searches, "calculator" presents an untapped opportunity.</p>
				<p>It became clear that there was an opportunity to tap into this search traffic, by creating specific landing pages targeting a large variety of vertical markets and niche uses, such as "online sales calculator", "online revenue calculator", "estimate calculator" and so on. </p>

				<h2 class="no-chapter">Competitors Are Built for Collaboration, Not for Making Spreadsheets Look Good</h2>
				<p>
					In the last few years, developers have added a lot of social features into spreadsheets, making it easier to share raw data. However, there has been little focus on the presentation spreadsheets – something that can tell the story behind the data. 
				</p>
				<p>
					For example, if a user has a quick calculation and sends it off to a client or other department, it is typically copy and pasted from Excel into some other application such as PowerPoint. While this is the easiest thing to do right now, it <b>renders the data dead</b>, unable to be explored by the user. This flies in the face of growing demand by a data audience who want to explore data themselves, as opposed to being handed static PowerPoints (footnote to Brendan Doohan).

				<h2  class="no-chapter">Demonstrating Value: Instant Styling</h2>
				<p>
					With extremely entrenched competition like Excel, <b>my app needed to prove its value instantly</b> to users when they first encounter it. Since the research showed that <B>users need to make their spreadsheets look good</b> and that formatting that data was time consuming, I decided to tackle a baseline of making it 20x faster for users to present their data.  
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>The spreadsheet would "suck in" the style of any website by giving it a URL.</b> For example, if a user put in "www.apple.com", the application would suck in and apply the typography, images, layout, etc to the aforementioned spreadsheet. The actual application of the style would be accomplished by a combination of computer-readable style elements, heuristics, and human workers behind the scenes.
				</p>
				
  				

				
				<h2  class="no-chapter">Generating Traffic: Calculator Landing Pages</h2>
				<p>
					Leveraging the keyword research earlier on, the app would have <i>hundreds</i> of different landing pages for all sorts of verticals that may need a predefined "calculator" that can be styled for their unique needs.
				</p>
			
				<h2  class="no-chapter">Monetization: Pay to Lock It Down</h2>
				<p>
					The application will be free to use and to share data with. By the presentation-nature of the application, the more viral it is, then more successful it will be. However, due also to the sensitive nature of business data, there are many cases where users may want to "lock it down", that is, require some level of password clearance. This is where the app can be monetized – offering enterprise-level security to the app by subscription. The security subscription can make sure only authenticated users can view presentations, and can integrated with single-signon technologies.
				</p>		
				
				
				<h1 class="page-header">Prototype</h1>
				<p>Usability is a high-level goal for the application, and so several rounds of prototypes were created to run usability tests with. The first prototype was a raw paper-based prototype, on which to test my initial assumptions. After applying lessons learned from the first prototype, I quickly iterated and built a more refined interactive prototype.</p>

						<h1 class="page-header no-chapter">Making it Real</h1>
						<p>It was clear from my initial survey that <b>users need their spreadsheets to look good</b>, which drove the rest of the project to build an app where users could beautifully style their spreadsheets for presentation, ridiculously fast. What was left was to build wireframes as a specification for developers, and to refine the prototype once more.</p>
						<h2  class="no-chapter">Future Steps</h2>
						<p>The next steps for production, would be to generate the landing pages to make sure the traffic hypothesis is correct, as this is a testable assumption without even the application. Assuming enough traffic is generated, the first public version would be generated. The "instant design" would start off with humans behind the scenes, actually assembling the pages. This is to identify patterns as to which elements are easiest to automate. This does mean a slow styling feature in the beginning, but it allows us to see what design challenges actually come up in the wild first.</p>
